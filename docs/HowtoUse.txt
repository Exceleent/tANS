How to use our Coder/Encoder
Remember that L :=2^n So sum of appearance of each symbol must be power of 2. In order to use encoder/decoder you must first fill up config filles.

Folder Encoder - Contains
*Core.h - declarations of functions.
*Core.c - definitions of functions.
*main.c - encoder function, which calls functions from Core.c
*main_test.c - example how use encoder.
*config - encoder reads data from this file. First column consist letters from our alphabet, range:0 - 255.( filled by you).
Second column consist number of appearances for each letter.
*symbols - first line consist starting state of encode then, sequence of symbols, we want to code.(filled by you).

Folder Decoder - Contains
*Bits.txt - sequence of bits we coded within our coder ( encoder fills it ).
*Core.c - definitions of functions.
*Core.h - declarations of functions .
*Nsymbols.txt - Alphabet size ( filled by you).
*Numbers.txt - Number of appearances for each letter. ( filled by you ).
*test_bench.c - main function calling decodingfunction.
*numberofBits.txt - Number of Bits we coded ( encoder fills it ).
*state.txt - starting state for decoder, ending state for encoder(encoder fills it ).
*symbols.txt - reversal sequence of decode symbols, and starting state for encoder.
